Developing Data Products Project
================================


This repository is where I have located my Developing Data Producst Project.

This is a Shiny application.  The application is a Body Mass Index (BMI)
calculator. 

It is very simple to use. Simply enter your height in inches, and your weight 
in pounds, and then press the submit button.  

The application will return your BMI, along with a diagnostic of where you 
fall on the BMI Scale. 

The files of the applications are:
* ui.R
* server.R

Initially the values with be NaN and NA for your BMI and the diagnostic.  It 
will populate a value after you press the submit button. 

The application is accesible in: https://jegroom2.shinyapps.io/DevelopingDataProducts

You can also see a pitch for the application at the following: http://jegroom102080.github.io/index.html
