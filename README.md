Developing Data Products Project
================================


This repository is where I have located my Developing Data Producst Project.

This is a Shiny application.  The application is a Body Mass Index (BMI)
calculator. 

It is very simple to use. Simply enter your height in inches, and your weight 
in pounds.  Then press the submit button, and the application will return your
BMI, along with a diagnostic of where you fall on the BMI Scale. 

The files of the applications are:
* ui.R
* server.R

The application is accesible in: https://jegroom2.shinyapps.io/DevelopingDataProducts
